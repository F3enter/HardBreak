# Hardware Tools

In this chapter we want to answer the question: _What do I need for a hardware lab?_

Hardware hacking tools are needed to access and interact with the physical components of a device. They allow to probe interfaces, extract data, and analyze communication protocols that are not accessible through software alone. Tools like logic analyzers, chip programmers, and software-defined radios enable the monitoring and manipulation of hardware-level signals, while debuggers and memory readers provide insights into the device's operation. Without these specialized devices, many hardware vulnerabilities would remain undiscovered or unexploitable.
