# JTAG and SWD Debuggers

JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) and SWD (Serial Wire Debug) are standard debugging interfaces used in embedded systems development. They allow engineers and pentesters to interact with microcontrollers and other programmable devices for testing, programming, and debugging purposes.

## JTAG Debuggers

Usage

* For debugging, it provides access to the internal state of a microcontroller, allowing breakpoints, single-stepping through code, and examining memory.
* It facilitates programming by enabling firmware to be flashed onto devices.
* In boundary scan, it is used to test interconnections on printed circuit boards (PCBs).

Theory

* JTAG operates with a 4 or 5-pin interface (TCK, TDI, TDO, TMS, and optional TRST) that controls the state and transfers data, allowing communication with the device without the need to probe individual pins.
* Multiple devices can be connected in a chain, allowing access to several components on a board simultaneously.

Models

1. Entry-Level
   * Bus Pirate($40): A basic USB interface for JTAG programming, often used in hobby projects.
2. Mid-Range
   * Segger J-Link($400): A widely used JTAG adapter compatible with various microcontroller architectures and development environments, often used by me
3. High-End
   * Lauterbach TRACE32 ($800) : A high-performance JTAG and SWD debugger, offering advanced debugging features.

## SWD Debuggers

Usage

* For debugging, SWD offers access to a microcontroller's internal features, similar to JTAG.
* It is used for programming by flashing firmware onto microcontrollers that support SWD.
* With a low pin count, it requires fewer pins than JTAG, making it ideal for smaller devices.

Theory

* SWD operates through a 2-pin interface (SWDIO, SWCLK), with optional reset and power lines. This streamlined design reduces the number of pins needed on the microcontroller.
* It enables bi-directional communication between the debugger and the target device, making it efficient for debugging.

Models

1. Entry-Level
   * ST-LINK/V2 ($30): A low-cost SWD programmer/debugger for STM32 microcontrollers, widely used in embedded systems.
2. Mid-Range
   * Segger J-Link ($400): Supports both JTAG and SWD, providing a good balance of features for embedded development.
3. High-End
   * Arm Keil ULINKpro ($800): A professional debugging interface with advanced features, ideal for complex embedded systems.
