# OSINT

OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) is the practice of collecting information from publicly available resources. In the context of IoT (Internet of Things) devices, this refers to gathering intelligence from a variety of sources to understand the ecosystem, identify potential vulnerabilities, or profile devices connected to networks. OSINT for a device is often overlooked. What to look for:

1\. Documentation

* Manufacturers release documentation detailing device functionalities.
* Key actions include Backup, USB Port usage, and Firmware Updates.

2\. Firmware Updates

* Public firmware may be available on manufacturers' websites.
* Allows for reverse engineering without dumping firmware directly from the device.

3\. Default Credentials

* Devices often come with default credentials that are easily exploitable, check websites for them

**4. Lookout for CVEs and blogs**

* Community forums may reveal unreported vulnerabilities.
* Security research papers can highlight known exploits and weaknesses.
