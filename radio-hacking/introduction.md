# Introduction

Radio hacking involves intercepting, analyzing, and sometimes manipulating the radio frequency (RF) signals used by various devices to communicate wirelessly. In the world of IoT, many devices rely on RF communication to connect and share data. This could include everything from smart home gadgets and remote sensors to wearable technology and industrial equipment. By studying the RF communication of IoT devices, we can gain insights into their data transmission patterns, understand potential security weaknesses and extract sensitve information. One goal could also be to forge or relay signals.

Radio hacking can be done with cheap hardware like the RTL-SDR to capture and analyze signals across different frequencies. We will also cover short range radio like RFID or NFC, which

Goals: Exploit vulnerabilities (RCE, passive data interception), gain information, understand RF protocol, relaying of signals
